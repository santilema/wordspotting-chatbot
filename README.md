## Hints to work with the repo without a problem:
#
## Everyone has his/her own branch, We all work inside our own branches.
#
### 1. Clone the repo first ---> git clone "your branch url"
### 2. Do your changes.
### 3. To push your changes to the repo follow the steps:
          #  git add .
          #  git commit -m "name your commit"
          #. git push origin "branch name"



# REACT app 
#

#
## to run the react app run "npm start" in the app directory
